## Steps I followed
1. The first step I did was to test if my board even worked so I tried to do the camera project again, found out the board worked and not the camera.

2. Then I tested the lights on the board.
   
3. The third step I did was setting up the callmebot api before even writing the code.

4. Writing the code and troubleshooting the API

5. Adding light functionality to my code for it to blink when connecting and stop when it connected.

## Problems
1. First problem I had is that I was on the wrong serial, I just changed the port and it fixed that issue.
